This is a plugin of [dde-dock](https://github.com/linuxdeepin/dde-dock) to facilitate user's control of MPD.

It shows the current state of the player and information about the currently played song. With four icons user can control the player to play or pause,switch mode(random or list) ,goto next or previous song respectively.

Hover over the plugin to see the current playing progress of the song.

**NOTE**: 

- This plugin does not support fashion mode,'Cause the author think it's unnecessary to control MPD from it
- User has to spare enough (about 200 pix) space for this plugin,so make your dock tidy :)
